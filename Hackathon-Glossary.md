## Terms

[A](#a) • [D](#d) • [F](#f) • [H](#h) • [I](#i) • [L](#l) • [M](#m) • [P](#p) • [S](#s)  • [T](#t)

### A

#### API

API is an acronym for **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface. You can
think of an API as a contract between you and a computer program. This
contract guarantees that if you provide some specific information to a
computer program, the computer program will do some specific task. At
hackathons two kinds of APIs are usually discussed: web application APIs and
software library APIs.  

In the case of **web application APIs**, the user provides some information to 
a web application, and then the web application either changes its state, or it
provides the user with some other information. An example of a web API that
allows a user to change the state of the application is the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public). 
By providing a Twitter username, the text of the tweet, and some other 
information, users can use the Twitter API to post a tweet. The [Sunlight Foundation Capitol Words API](http://sunlightlabs.github.io/Capitol-Words/) 
is a web API that provides information. If a user provides an English phrase to 
the Capitol Words API, it will return to the user the number of times that phrase
has been said over time during US congressional sessions.  

**Software [library](#library) APIs specify** how to use a software library, and 
how a software library will behave within a computer program. An example 
of a software library API is the [Array API](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html) 
in the Ruby programming language.  
  
  
### D

#### Developer Evangelist
Also known as a **devangelist**, this person is a mentor, a teacher, a
programmer, an advocate, a translator. This position straddles the line
between engineering and marketing, explaining technology to a variety of 
audiences, aiming to convince said audiences to use that technology, getting 
excited about it.
  
    
### F

#### Framework
A standard structure of an application.
    
### H

#### HTTP
HTTP is an acronym for **H**yper**T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol.
  
  
### I

#### IP
See [**Protocol**](#protocol)
    
  
### L

#### Library


### M

#### MVP
MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product - one with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future product development.
    
    
### P

#### Package

#### *Protocol*
A protocol is a system of rules that explain the correct conduct and
procedures to be followed in a given situation.   

**For example**, the [**IP**](#ip) (**I**nternet **P**rotocol) defines a set
of rules to send and receive messages at the Internet address level.
     
  
### S

#### SDK
SDK is an acronym for **s**oftware **d**evelopment **k**it, which is a set of
dev tools that makes it easier for developers to make apps for a specific
platform (ie. iOS, Android, web...), package, framework, and more. SDKs are
similar to [APIs](#api), but one key difference is that all SDKs include or
are APIs, but not all APIs are SDKs.  
  
   
### T

#### TCP
  
    
  

## Additional Resources
* [Tech Bootcamp Coding Dojo's Glossary](http://www.codingdojo.com/glossary)  
  Quick, non-technical definitions.  
* [WhatIs.techtarget.com](http://whatis.techtarget.com/)  
  Explains the key aspects of thousands of tech terms. Generally more approachable 
  (i.e. assumes less background knowledge) than the Wikipedia entry. 
  Searchable by term or subject.  
* [Wikipedia's List of Computing \& IT Abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computing_and_IT_abbreviations)  
  Useful for quickly finding out what an acronym stands for, without sifting 
  through unrelated search results.
